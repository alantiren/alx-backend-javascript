## 1. Description

This repository serves as a learning platform for mastering JavaScript backend testing. It covers a variety of testing libraries and techniques, providing hands-on tasks to reinforce your understanding. Whether you're new to testing or looking to refine your skills, this project is designed to guide you through the fundamentals.

## 2. Project Structure

The project is organized into tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of testing. Here's an overview of the project's structure:

- **0x06-unittests_in_js/**
  - **[0-calcul.js](0x06-unittests_in_js/0-calcul.js)**: Basic calculation function.
  - **[0-calcul.test.js](0x06-unittests_in_js/0-calcul.test.js)**: Test suite for the calculation function.
  - **[1-calcul.js](0x06-unittests_in_js/1-calcul.js)**: Extended calculation function with different operations.
  - **[1-calcul.test.js](0x06-unittests_in_js/1-calcul.test.js)**: Test suite using the Chai assertion library.
  - **[2-calcul_chai.js](0x06-unittests_in_js/2-calcul_chai.js)**: Same as 1-calcul.js, now using Chai.
  - **[2-calcul_chai.test.js](0x06-unittests_in_js/2-calcul_chai.test.js)**: Chai-based test suite.
  - **[utils.js](0x06-unittests_in_js/utils.js)**: Utility module with a calculation function.
  - **[3-payment.js](0x06-unittests_in_js/3-payment.js)**: Function related to payment using Utils.calculateNumber.
  - **[3-payment.test.js](0x06-unittests_in_js/3-payment.test.js)**: Test suite with Sinon spies.
  - **[4-payment.js](0x06-unittests_in_js/4-payment.js)**: Same as 3-payment.js, now using Sinon stubs.
  - **[4-payment.test.js](0x06-unittests_in_js/4-payment.test.js)**: Test suite with Sinon stubs.
  - **[5-payment.js](0x06-unittests_in_js/5-payment.js)**: Using Mocha hooks for setup and teardown.
  - **[5-payment.test.js](0x06-unittests_in_js/5-payment.test.js)**: Test suite using a single Sinon spy.
  - **[6-payment_token.js](0x06-unittests_in_js/6-payment_token.js)**: Async function for testing.
  - **[6-payment_token.test.js](0x06-unittests_in_js/6-payment_token.test.js)**: Test suite for the async function.
  - **[7-skip.test.js](0x06-unittests_in_js/7-skip.test.js)**: Test suite with skipped tests.
  - **[8-api/](0x06-unittests_in_js/8-api/)**: Folder for integration testing with Express.
  - **[9-api/](0x06-unittests_in_js/9-api/)**: Folder for regex integration testing with Express.
  - **[10-api/](0x06-unittests_in_js/10-api/)**: Folder for post integration testing with Express.

## 3. Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd alx-backend-javascript
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 4. Tasks Overview

Explore each task in the `0x06-unittests_in_js` directory for detailed instructions and exercises on various testing concepts:

- Basic tests with Mocha and Node assertion library
- Combining descriptions for more complex functions
- Basic tests using Chai assertion library for behavior-driven development
- Spies: Logging useful information about function calls
- Stubs: Providing different implementations of wrapped functions
- Hooks: Executing functions before and after tests
- Async tests with the `done` callback
- Skipping tests when needed
- Basic integration testing with Express
- Regex integration testing for route validation
- Deep equality and post integration testing with Express

## 5. Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies:

- **Mocha**: A feature-rich JavaScript test framework.
- **Chai**: A BDD / TDD assertion library for Node.js.
- **Sinon**: A library for spies, stubs, and mocks.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **Request

**: Simplified HTTP client for making requests.

Refer to the `package.json` file for version details.

## 6. Usage
